# Introduction

If you are wanting to go down the route of having a completely separate SPA that consumes a Laravel API then these docs should provide all the reference you need to get things set up.

The example project files can be found on GitHub:

- [Larvel API](https://github.com/CaribesTIC/laravel-backend)
- [Vue SPA](https://github.com/CaribesTIC/vue-frontend-ts)
